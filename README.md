Comprehensive and modular geometry toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript
developed in a literate programming style.

Currently BETA quality, largely stable, but pre-release software. The
libraries have been used in production for several projects, but
further breaking API changes are still forthcoming...

**Note:** This library relies on the new
conditional reader syntax of recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions
and therefore is **not compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**...

## Description & usage

See [index.org](src/index.org) for details. Also please note, the
[dev branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/develop) is (as one
might expect) often quite a bit ahead of master and I'm aiming to push
at least weekly snapshots of all modules to
[clojars.org](http://clojars.org)...

## Current Leiningen coordinates

```clj
[thi.ng/geom "0.0.1062"]
```

## Getting started

Tutorials are non-existing so far, but are on the TODO list. However for examples, there are various snippets lingering throughout the codebase and various workshop repos:
