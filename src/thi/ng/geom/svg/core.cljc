;; Attribute conversion

;; Colors in SVG need to be defined as CSS color strings and hence are
;; completely opaque to other parts of the code base and which might
;; deal with the dynamic generation of color values. Therefore we
;; allow the `:stroke` and `:fill` attributes to be defined as any
;; color type defined by the http://thi.ng/color library (RGB, HSV,
;; HSL, CMYK, YUV etc.). If these attributes are present and *not*
;; already a string value, they will be converted into a CSS color
;; automatically (using the polymorphic `as-css` protocol method of
;; thi.ng/color).
;;
;; *Note:* The same applies to specifying colors in gradients (see
;; `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient` functions below).

;; Transforms
;;
;; Many SVG elements support the attachment of local coordinate
;; transformations. If a `:transform` attribute has a non-string
;; value, it will be interpreted as a `Matrix32` or equivalent
;; 6-element vector and will be automatically converted.
