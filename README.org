* About the project

** Status

The project was in active, almost daily development from late 2011 - summer 2016
during its 4th iteration/rewrite cycle. Originally developed in a Literate
Programming style using Emacs & Org-mode, in May 2018 it was decided to revert
to a traditional Clojure project setup to encourage more contributions from
other interested parties. The original .org source files are kept for reference
in the [[./org/]] directory until further notice.

Regardless of version number, the library is mature and has been used
successfully in several commercial projects over the past 10 years and can be
considered stable for most use cases.

Clojure (not ClojureScript), the following additional native
dependencies must be added to your project (for each platform you
intend to use):

** Overview

thi.ng/geom is a comprehensive and modular geometry & visualization
toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript. It provides a large set of purely
math & geometry oriented data types, a polymorphic, largely protocol
based API to transform/convert types and various ways to create
interactive visualizations in SVG, WebGL, OpenGL, both in the browser
and in desktop environments.

Embracing Clojure's approach of data transformations, the library's
core philosophy is based on a functional approach to generative design
tasks with hundreds of hours spent on refining & optimizing the core
API for both Clojure & Clojurescript.

Unlike most other open source projects, this project has been
developed in a literate programming style and has been in active,
regular development since late 2011, currently in its 4th
iteration/rewrite cycle.

*You're highly encouraged to consult the source code, which contains
documentation, examples, diagrams and general usage pattern hints.*

This project is part of the [[https://github.com/thi-ng/][thi.ng]] collection of Clojure &
Clojurescript libraries and makes uses of several other projects in
this collection (see dependencies further below).

*** API scope

Since the core library does only deal with pure "platonic" geometry
types, it doesn't directly address any display or rendering
functionality at all. However a number of support modules are
provided, incl. OpenGL 3/4, WebGL & SVG support, to allow visualizing
results and/or exporting generated assets. 2D/3D shape/mesh exporters
are provided as well and together with sister libraries like
[[https://github.com/thi-ng/luxor][thi.ng/luxor]], it's also possible to generate complete 3D scenes for
high quality & high resolution non-realtime rendering using [[https://github.com/LuxRender][Luxrender]] now [[https://luxcorerender.org/][LuxCoreRender]].

Furthermore, providing all functionality under a common API for both
Clojure & Clojurescript, makes it trivial to offload heavy operations
(e.g. large mesh processing) to the server side.

** Project structure
*** core

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/core/][source]]

These namespaces define the core functionality of this library,
including the approx. 50 protocols and implementations of fundamental
geometry types/functions like 2d/3d vector algebra, matrices,
quaternion (+ related convenience constructors & conversions)

*** types

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/][source]]

This directory contains all high-level 2d/3d data types with their
implementations of the various core protocols. From a user
perspective, these namespaces defined here provide most of this
project's core functionality.

*** utils

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/utils/][source]]

A number of often needed utility functions to deal with point
collections, normals, path sampling, triangle properties etc. Also
included here are shape intersection tests, curve subdivisions and 2D
Delaunay triangulation.

*** mesh

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/mesh/][source]]

Several tools & operations related to working with 3d meshes, incl.
I/O, subdivisions, repair / cleaning, CSG / Boolean mesh merge,
mesh generators (polyhedra, lathe etc.)

*** physics

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/physics/][source]]

This module provides a simple 2d/3d particle-based physics engine with
Verlet integration and support for custom behaviors and constaints,
both for individual particles and global. Particles can be connected
with springs of varying stiffness as well as made interdependent using
positive or negative force fields (attractors).

*** svg

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/svg/][source]]

A module to help with building SVG based visualizations of geom
entities using hiccup compatible syntax. Includes a customizable 3D
mesh renderer w/ software shader support.

*** viz

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/viz/][source]]

Declarative, highly customizable 2D data visualization module with ~10
different layout methods, 3 axis types, cartesian and polar domain
support. Currently SVG only, but planned to be format-independent.

*** voxel

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/voxel/][source]]

An experimental implementation of a in-memory sparse voxel tree (SVO)
and related functionality to extract isosurface polygon meshes from
the tree.

*** OpenGL & WebGL

[[./src/thi/ng/geom/gl/][source]]

This module provides a unified API to common OpenGL/WebGL
functionality (context creation, shader management & presets, buffer
management, textures, FBO etc.), as well as a number of optimized mesh
types, conversion & rendering functions, cameras etc. to simplify the
use of other geometry types defined in this project with OpenGL, both on
the desktop and in the browser. The Clojure version wraps JOGL.
